Hey {name} - How’s it going!?

We’re looking for couples around {age}ish to move in with us. We’ve some lovely, furnished couple rooms ($355-$480/week) - and you’d live with a mix of friendly international + Aussie housemates / students. 

Can you click the above "Celina & Genesis has X active listings" link from within this conversation? It’ll show you our houses so you can tell me which you like :p

Go to bit.ly/cocoonhomes to can see availabilities, 3D walkthroughs, prices, distances to universities, and flatmate info!

Tell me times you can do viewings {day} (or send me questions)! Our places sell fast ;)

Cheers, 
Celina from Cocoon
