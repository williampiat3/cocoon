Hey {name} - How’s it going!?

We’re looking for people around your age ({age}ish) to move in with us! We have lovely, furnished, two person share rooms ($200-$270/week/bed) - and you’d live with a mix of friendly international + Aussie housemates / students. 

Can you click the above "Celina & Genesis has X active listings" link from within this conversation? It’ll show you our houses so you can tell me which you like :p

Tell me any times you can do viewings {day} (or send me questions)! Our places sell fast ;)

Cheers, 
Celina from Cocoon
