# Cocoon documentation
## Introduction
Here is the documentation for all the scripts and all the processes running for cocoon with a description of all the processes running
There are basically two types of processes running on the platform app script processes that are meant to run the old processes and processes running on the google cloud platform.
All the information of the company is stored on the Cloud SQL which is a MySQL database 
I believe the easiest way to introduce you to the structure of all the script perhaps it's easier to introduce you to the data structure first
